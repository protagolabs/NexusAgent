## Why it exists

Guards the generic `lark_cli` MCP tool against dangerous or unintended
CLI commands. Without this, an Agent could run `config remove`, `auth
logout`, or inject shell metacharacters.

## Design decisions

- **Whitelist approach** — only known-safe top-level commands are allowed
  (im, contact, calendar, docs, task, drive, schema, api, auth, doctor,
  etc.). Unknown commands are blocked by default.
- **Blocklist for specific subcommands** — even within allowed top-level
  commands, dangerous operations are blocked: `config init`, `config
  remove`, `profile remove`, `auth login`, `auth logout`, `event
  +subscribe`, `update` (CLI self-update).
- **Shell metachar regex** — blocks `|`, `;`, `&`, backtick, `$`, `(`, `)`
  to prevent shell injection. Curly braces `{}` and square brackets `[]`
  are allowed because they appear in JSON `--data` arguments.
- **`sanitize_command` uses `shlex.split`** — safely tokenizes the command
  string. This runs with `shell=False` (subprocess), so shell injection
  is impossible even if regex is bypassed.

## Upstream / downstream

- **Upstream**: `_lark_mcp_tools.py` calls `validate_command()` and
  `sanitize_command()` before every `lark_cli` invocation.
- **Downstream**: none (leaf module).

## Gotchas

- The blocklist checks if the command string *starts with* the blocked
  pattern (after normalization). A creative command like
  `im +messages-send; config remove` would be caught by the shell
  metachar regex (`; ` contains `;`), not by the blocklist.
- `--format json` is NOT blocked but should not be added to Shortcut
  commands (those with `+`). This is documented in Agent instructions,
  not enforced here.
