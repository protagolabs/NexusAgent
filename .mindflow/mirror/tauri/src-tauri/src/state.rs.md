# state.rs — AppState, ServiceDef, and path resolution for the Tauri app

The central configuration file for the desktop app. Defines:

- `AppConfig` — mode (local/cloud), api_base_url, python_path, db_path
- `ServiceDef` — one per child process (id, label, command, args, cwd, port,
  health_url, order, startup_delay_ms)
- `AppState` — Tauri managed state holding config, process_manager,
  health_monitor, and service_defs
- Path resolution helpers: `resolve_resource_dir`, `resolve_project_root`,
  `resolve_python_path`, `resolve_db_path`, `is_bundled`

## Why path resolution is non-trivial

A macOS `.app` bundle has a specific directory layout:
```
NarraNexus.app/
  Contents/
    MacOS/narranexus        ← executable
    Resources/resources/
      project/              ← Python project root
      python/bin/python3    ← bundled Python
```

Development layout:
```
tauri/src-tauri/     ← CWD during dev
../../              ← project root (two levels up)
uv                  ← Python via PATH
```

`is_bundled()` detects which layout is active by checking for the bundled
Python path. The service factories (`bundled_services` vs `dev_services`)
choose the right commands based on this.

## The two service factories

`bundled_services` uses the absolute Python path directly (no `uv`).
`dev_services` prefixes all commands with `uv run python ...` for the
virtual-env-managed dev workflow.

Both factories define the same seven services in the same order:
1. sqlite_proxy (order 0, 3 s startup delay)
2. backend (order 1) — uvicorn args include `--ws-ping-interval 30
   --ws-ping-timeout 60` so long-running Agent turns don't drop the WS stream
3. mcp (order 2)
4. poller (order 3)
5. job_trigger (order 4)
6. message_bus_trigger (order 5)
7. lark_trigger (order 6)

**These MUST stay in sync with `scripts/dev-local.sh` (CLAUDE.md rule #7).**
Specifically the backend uvicorn ws-ping args above — mismatching the two
makes chat streams drop on the dmg while they survive on dev.

## The SQLite proxy startup delay

Order 0 (sqlite_proxy) has `startup_delay_ms: Some(3000)`. This mirrors the
`sleep 3` in `scripts/dev-local.sh`. Without this delay, backend/mcp/poller
try to connect to the proxy before it binds port 8100 and crash. The value
was chosen empirically — on slow machines 3 s may not be enough.

## Bundled Node.js + CLI helper

`resolve_bundled_node_bins()` returns the two directories that must be on
PATH for every Python child process when running from the dmg:
  `resources/nodejs/bin` (real node interpreter) and
  `resources/nodejs/node_modules/.bin` (the `claude` / `lark-cli` shims).

Layout is produced by `scripts/build-desktop.sh` step 3.5-3.6. In dev mode
the helper returns an empty Vec — dev users already have node + CLIs on
their shell PATH.

`sidecar::process_manager::start_service` reads this helper and prepends the
paths to the PATH env var it passes each child. Without that prefix,
`claude_agent_sdk` cannot find the `claude` binary and the chat loop dies
with "No such file or directory".

## Gotchas

`resolve_db_path` always uses `~/.narranexus/nexus.db` regardless of mode.
There is no per-user or per-environment isolation. Running two agents
simultaneously from different installations shares the same database.
