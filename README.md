> Most agent frameworks focus on making agents *smarter*.
> **NarraNexus focuses on making agents *connected*.**

An agent in isolation is a tool. An agent with memory, identity, relationships, and goals becomes a participant in a **nexus** — a network where intelligence is a collective property, not just a model property.

NarraNexus provides the infrastructure for this: persistent memory, relationship-aware context, task scheduling, modular capabilities, and agent-to-agent communication.

---

## What Makes NarraNexus Different

### Persistent Context
*Agents that remember — across sessions, conversations, and relationships.*

NarraNexus agents carry context across conversations through long-term memory, event memory, and relationship-aware retrieval. They continue from past interactions instead of starting over every time.

### Composable Runtime
*Every capability is a hot-swappable module.*

Core capabilities such as Memory, Awareness, Chat, RAG, Jobs, Skills, Social Network, and Matrix run as independent modules. Each module manages its own tools, data, and lifecycle, making the system easy to extend or customize.

### Connected Agents
*Built for collaboration, not just conversation.*

Agents can communicate through Matrix-based messaging and use MCP tools to coordinate with other agents, external tools, and background workflows.

## Quick Start

###  Online Version
*Try NarraNexus instantly in the browser — no install needed.*

> **[Launch NarraNexus →](https://website.narra.nexus/)**

###  Download the App (macOS only)
*Native desktop app with auto-updater.*

> **[Download Latest Release →](https://github.com/NetMindAI-Open/NarraNexus/releases)** — choose the file ending with `.dmg`.

###  Install from Source

#### Prerequisites

| Dependency | Why | Install |
|------------|-----|---------|
| **Node.js** (v20+) | Frontend build | Install via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (recommended): `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh \| bash && nvm install 20` |
| **uv** | Python environment & dependency management | `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh \| sh` |

> [!TIP]
> If either dependency is missing, `run.sh` will print the install command and exit. Install it, then re-run.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NetMindAI-Open/NarraNexus.git
cd NarraNexus
bash run.sh
```

The script auto-detects your OS (Linux / macOS / Windows WSL2) and handles the rest of the dependencies.

**Once setup completes:**

1. Open **`http://localhost:5173`** in your browser
   - Choose **Local** or **Cloud (Coming soon)** mode to register an account
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to set up the API key — see [LLM Provider Configuration](#llm-provider-configuration)
   - Start chatting!
2. Open **`http://localhost:8000/docs`** for API Docs

## LLM Provider Configuration

NarraNexus uses a **three-slot architecture** for LLM access:

| Slot | Protocol | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Agent** | Anthropic | Core reasoning — powers thinking, tool use, and multi-turn conversations |
| **Embedding** | OpenAI | Converts text to vectors for narrative matching and semantic search |
| **Helper LLM** | OpenAI | Lightweight tasks — entity extraction, summarization, module decisions |

### Setup Options

| Option | What you need | Result |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| **[NetMind.AI Power](https://www.netmind.ai/)** | One API key | Covers all 3 slots — quickest setup |
| **Claude Code Login + OpenAI** | Claude Code CLI login + OpenAI API key | Agent via OAuth (free tier available), rest via OpenAI |
| **Anthropic + OpenAI** | Anthropic API key + OpenAI API key | Full control over both providers |
| **Custom endpoints** | Any Anthropic/OpenAI-compatible URL | For proxies, self-hosted models, or alternatives |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently only **OpenAI official API** and **NetMind.AI Power** are supported for embedding. More providers coming soon.

Configure through the **setup wizard** (desktop app) or the **LLM Providers panel** (web UI — click the CPU icon in the header). Config is stored at `~/.nexusagent/llm_config.json`.

| **Social Network** | Entity graph tracking people, relationships, expertise, and interaction history |
| **Job Scheduling** | One-shot, cron, periodic, and continuous tasks with dependency DAGs |
| **RAG Knowledge Base** | Document indexing and semantic retrieval via Gemini File Search |
