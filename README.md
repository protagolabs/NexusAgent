Most agent frameworks focus on making agents *smarter*. NarraNexus focuses on making agents *connected*.

An agent in isolation is a tool. An agent with persistent memory, social identity, relationships, and goals becomes a participant in a **nexus** -- a network where intelligence is a collective property, not a model property.

NarraNexus provides the infrastructure for this: narrative memory that grows across conversations, a social graph that tracks real-world relationships, task scheduling with dependency chains, and modular capabilities that can be composed at runtime.

## What Makes NarraNexus Different

NarraNexus is a modular agent platform designed for long-term memory, contextual awareness, extensibility, and multi-agent collaboration.

### Long-Term Memory

Powered by **EverMemOS**, NarraNexus stores and retrieves memories across MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and Milvus. This allows agents to remember past interactions, retrieve relevant context, and maintain continuity across conversations.

### Context Awareness

The Awareness Module extracts entities, detects intent, identifies topics, and analyzes emotional tone. This context helps other modules retrieve better memories, understand relationships, and decide what information matters.

### Modular Architecture

NarraNexus is built from independent modules, including Chat, Memory, Awareness, Social Network, Jobs, RAG, Skills, Matrix, and Event Memory. Each module manages its own data, tools, and lifecycle, making the platform easy to extend or customize.

### Agent-to-Agent Communication

Through the Matrix protocol and a Synapse homeserver, agents can communicate with each other, join rooms, send messages, retrieve history, and coordinate multi-agent workflows.

### Extensible Skills

The Skills Module connects agents to **ClawHub**, where reusable capabilities can be discovered, installed, updated, and removed at runtime.

### Background Jobs

The Jobs Module supports cron, periodic, continuous, and DAG-based workflows, allowing agents to schedule tasks, monitor conditions, and perform asynchronous work.

### Document-Based RAG

The RAG Module uses **Google Gemini File Search** to index uploaded documents and retrieve relevant passages for grounded, source-aware responses.

### Episodic Event Memory

The Event Memory Module stores significant episodes, such as important conversations, decisions, milestones, and meaningful user interactions, helping agents build a more natural sense of continuity.

## Quick Start
### Online Version

Try NarraNexus instantly in your browser:

[Launch NarraNexus](https://www.narranexus-agent.ai/)

### Download the App

Download the latest desktop app from GitHub Releases.  
For macOS, choose the file ending with `.dmg`.

[Download Latest Release](https://github.com/protagolabs/NarraNexus/releases)

### Install from Source

**Windows users**: WSL2 is **required**. Install it first in PowerShell (Admin): `wsl --install`, then run all commands inside WSL2.

**macOS users**:  Following tools might be missing:
| Tool | How to install |
|------|---------------|
| [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) | `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"` |
| [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) | Download from official site and launch |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20) | Install via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm): `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh \| bash && nvm install 20` |

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NetMindAI-Open/NarraNexus.git
cd NarraNexus
bash run.sh
```

The script auto-detects your OS (Linux / macOS / Windows WSL2) and handles everything -- Python, Docker, Node.js, MySQL, dependencies, and configuration. Just follow the prompts.

After setup, you will see the image below. Then, 
1. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser to enter UI interface,

    a. Choose **Local** or **Cloud** mode to register an account.
2. `http://localhost:8000/docs` for API Docs.

## LLM Provider Configuration

NarraNexus uses a **three-slot** architecture for LLM access:

| Slot | Protocol | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Agent** | Anthropic | Core reasoning -- powers the agent's thinking, tool use, and multi-turn conversations |
| **Embedding** | OpenAI | Converts text to vectors for narrative matching and semantic search |
| **Helper LLM** | OpenAI | Lightweight tasks -- entity extraction, summarization, module decisions |

### Setup Options

| Option | What you need | Result |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| **[NetMind.AI Power](https://www.netmind.ai/)** | One API key | Covers all 3 slots. Quickest setup. |
| **Claude Code Login + OpenAI** | Claude Code CLI login + OpenAI API key | Agent via OAuth (free tier available), rest via OpenAI |
| **Anthropic + OpenAI** | Anthropic API key + OpenAI API key | Full control over both providers |
| **Custom endpoints** | Any Anthropic/OpenAI compatible URL | For proxies, self-hosted models, or alternatives |

> **Note**: Currently only **OpenAI official API** and **NetMind.AI Power** are supported for embedding. More providers coming soon.

Configure through the setup wizard (desktop app) or the LLM Providers panel (web UI, click the CPU icon in the header). Config is stored at `~/.nexusagent/llm_config.json`.

### Optional API Keys

| Dependency | Purpose | How to get |
|------------|---------|------------|
| **Google Gemini** | RAG Knowledge Base (Gemini File Search) | [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) |
| **EverMemOS LLM** | Long-term memory extraction | [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) (default) |
| **EverMemOS Embedding/Rerank** | Semantic search over memories | [DeepInfra](https://deepinfra.com/) (default) |

If not configured, the agent still works -- just without long-term memory features.

## Configure Long-term Memory (EverMemOS)

EverMemOS gives the agent long-term episodic memory. On first run, `bash run.sh` walks you through an interactive setup wizard. All options are skippable:

| What you configure | Result |
|--------------------|--------|
| **Nothing** | Agent works normally, memory features disabled |
| **LLM key only** | Memory extraction enabled, semantic search needs additional keys |
| **All keys** | Full long-term memory -- cloud-based, no GPU required **(recommended)** |

You can also edit `.evermemos/.env` manually at any time. See the [EverMemOS documentation](https://github.com/EverMind-AI/EverMemOS) for details.



## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|

| **Hot-Swappable Modules** | Standalone capabilities (chat, social graph, RAG, jobs, skills) with their own DB, tools, and hooks |
| **Inter-Agent Communication** | Agents coordinate via Matrix protocol -- rooms, messages, @mentions, group chats |
| **Skill Marketplace** | Browse and install skills from ClawHub via natural language |
| **Social Network** | Entity graph tracking people, relationships, expertise, and interaction history |
| **Job Scheduling** | One-shot, cron, periodic, and continuous tasks with dependency DAGs |
| **RAG Knowledge Base** | Document indexing and semantic retrieval via Gemini File Search |

| **Cost Tracking** | Real-time metering of every LLM call with per-model cost breakdowns |
| **Execution Transparency** | Every pipeline step visible in real time -- what the agent decided, why, and what changed |
| **Multi-LLM Support** | Claude, OpenAI, and Gemini via unified adapter layer |
| **Desktop App** | Desktop application with auto-updater and one-click service orchestration |
