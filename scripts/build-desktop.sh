#   subprocesses get the launchd minimal PATH (`/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`)
#   that usually doesn't include ~/.npm-global/bin, /opt/homebrew/bin, etc.
#   The only robust answer is to ship node + the CLIs inside the app bundle
#   and have process_manager.rs prepend their directories to PATH for every
#   spawned Python service.
#
# lark-cli is shipped the same way — previously run.sh did a best-effort
# `npm install -g @larksuite/cli`, which again required node on the user
# machine. Bundling it eliminates that dependency too.

# Harden Node's bundled CLI shims against Tauri bundler symlink flattening.
#
# Node ships bin/npm, bin/npx, bin/corepack as SYMLINKS pointing into
# ../lib/node_modules/<pkg>/bin/<script>.js. Tauri's bundler (tauri-bundler)
# uses std::fs::copy when copying resources/nodejs/** into the .app, and
# std::fs::copy follows symlinks — so each symlinked shim gets replaced by a
# flat copy of its target JS script. Once flattened, the script's
# `__dirname` becomes `<bundle>/nodejs/bin/` instead of the package's
# scripts/ dir, and every relative require (`../lib/cli.js` etc.) fails
# with MODULE_NOT_FOUND at runtime. This was discovered when
# lark_preflight's bundled-npx call silently failed and the lark_skill
# MCP tool couldn't find SKILL.md on users' machines.
#
# Fix: before running any npm command that will walk those bins, replace
# them with bash shims that resolve the target via $(dirname "$0"). Bash
# shims are just regular files — they survive flattening because they
# don't CARE whether their invocation path is a symlink or a real file.
#
# Note: bin/node itself is a native Mach-O executable, not a shim; no
# replacement needed.

# Replace the npm-generated `.bin/lark-cli` wrapper with a bash shim.
#
# Background (diagnosed 2026-04-23):
#   @larksuite/cli 1.0.x ships a Node.js wrapper at scripts/run.js that
#   package.json registers as its bin entry. npm normally creates
#   `.bin/lark-cli` as a **symlink** to `../@larksuite/cli/scripts/run.js`.
#   When Node executes the symlink, it resolves to the real path, so
#   `__dirname` is `@larksuite/cli/scripts/` and the wrapper's
#   `path.join(__dirname, "..", "bin", "lark-cli")` correctly locates the
#   native Go binary at `@larksuite/cli/bin/lark-cli`.
#
#   BUT: Tauri's bundler (tauri-bundler) uses `std::fs::copy` when copying
#   `resources/nodejs/**/*` into the .app, which **follows symlinks** —
#   the symlinked `.bin/lark-cli` becomes a regular file whose content is
#   a verbatim copy of scripts/run.js. Now `__dirname` is `.bin/` instead
#   of `scripts/`, `path.join(.bin/, "..", "bin", "lark-cli")` resolves to
#   `node_modules/bin/lark-cli` (doesn't exist), the wrapper falls back to
#   `require("./install.js")` which also doesn't exist at `.bin/install.js`,
#   and the user sees a cryptic MODULE_NOT_FOUND at first launch.
#
#   Claude-code's bin/claude.exe is a pre-compiled Mach-O binary, so
#   flattening the symlink produces another valid executable — it "just
#   works" and doesn't need this shim.
#
# Fix: Post-install, overwrite `.bin/lark-cli` with a bash shim that
# locates the native binary relative to `$0` (the shim's path at runtime),
# not `__dirname`. Bash shims don't care about symlink resolution because
# they use `$0` / `$(dirname "$0")` which always expands to the invocation
# path. They survive the symlink flattening intact.

#   /Volumes/NarraNexus/
#     NarraNexus.app         ← your app
#     Applications  →  /Applications  (symlink, shown in Finder as "应用程序")
#
# The symlink is what produces the classic "drag the app onto the
# Applications folder to install" experience. Without it, hdiutil opens the
# DMG with just the .app sitting alone and the user has no visual cue where
# to drop it — they often end up running the app straight out of the mounted
# DMG volume (slow + breaks on eject).
#
# To get positioning / background image / custom icon-view layout, we'd need
# an AppleScript pass + a custom .DS_Store. That's 50 lines of fiddly code
# for UI polish; skipping until we have a proper installer design.
