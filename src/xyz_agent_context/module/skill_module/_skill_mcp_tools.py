@description: SkillModule MCP Server tool definitions

Stateless MCP tools — each tool accepts agent_id + user_id and constructs
a temporary SkillModule instance to access the correct skills directory.
This follows the same pattern as ChatModule/JobModule MCP tools.

Tools:
- skill_save_config: Save an environment variable for a skill
- skill_list_required_env: Query a skill's required env vars and config status
- skill_save_study_summary: Save a structured study summary for a skill

        **WHEN TO CALL**: Every time you obtain a credential — API key, token, secret,
        account ID — you MUST call this tool. Even if you also saved it to a local file
        as the SKILL.md instructed. Without this call, the credential will NOT appear
        in the frontend config panel and will NOT be auto-injected at runtime.

        Common triggers:
        - You just registered on a platform and received an API key
        - A user gave you a key/token in conversation and asked you to configure it
        - You generated or rotated a credential during skill setup

            env_key: Environment variable name (e.g. "ARENA_API_KEY").
            env_value: The value to store (e.g. "arena_sk_xxxxx").

            Confirmation message.
