@description: Lark event trigger — listens for incoming messages via
lark-oapi SDK WebSocket long connection.

Architecture: 1 WebSocket thread per bound bot + N shared async workers.
When a colleague sends a message to the bot, the trigger:
1. SDK callback puts event into async task_queue
2. Worker picks up event, builds context via LarkContextBuilder
3. Runs AgentRuntime
4. Writes result to Inbox

# H-6 (2026-04-27): replace lark_oapi.ws.client.loop module global with a
# thread-local proxy.
#
# Background — what the SDK does:
# `lark_oapi.ws.client` defines a module-level `loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()`
# captured once at import time on the main thread. Every Client method then
# reads this global at every use:
#     loop.run_until_complete(self._connect())
#     loop.create_task(self._receive_message_loop())
#     loop.create_task(self._handle_message(msg))
#     ...
# The SDK is implicitly designed for one Client per process.
#
# Why the previous M-9 patch was insufficient:
# NarraNexus runs N Client instances concurrently — one daemon thread per bot
# — and the previous workaround patched `ws_mod.loop = fresh_loop` per thread
# under `_WS_LOOP_PATCH_LOCK`. The lock only covered the assignment, not the
# subsequent `ws_client.start()` call. After thread A released the lock,
# thread B could overwrite the global with `fresh_loop_B`. Thread A's
# `start()` then reads `loop` on every line, intermittently picking up
# thread B's loop, and the `_receive_message_loop` task ends up bound to a
# different loop than the websocket future it awaits. Result:
# `RuntimeError: Task got Future <Future pending> attached to a different
# loop`. Reproduced in /tmp/lark_loop_race_reproducer.py: 28/40 observations
# saw a foreign thread's loop with 5 racing threads.
#
# Why the proxy is the correct fix:
# `asyncio.get_event_loop()` is already thread-local — `asyncio.set_event_loop`
# stores the loop in the calling thread's slot, and `get_event_loop` reads
# back the calling thread's slot. By replacing the SDK's module global with a
# proxy that delegates every attribute access to `asyncio.get_event_loop()`,
# every SDK call from thread T resolves to thread T's own loop, with no
# shared mutable state across threads. _subscribe_loop only needs to call
# `asyncio.set_event_loop(fresh_loop)` once per thread — no module-level
# patching, no lock, no race window.
#
# This patch is applied once at module import time below; threads do nothing.
