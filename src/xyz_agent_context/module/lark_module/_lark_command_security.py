@description: Security layer for the generic lark_cli MCP tool.

Validates commands against a whitelist of allowed top-level domains and
a blocklist of dangerous operations. Prevents shell injection and
secret leakage.

`auth login` is partially allowed: bare `auth login` and `auth login
--recommend` (initial OAuth bundle) remain blocked — those must go
through `lark_permission_advance` which owns the three-click state
machine. `auth login --scope <X>` is allowed as an incremental
scope top-up, for the case where `--recommend` didn't cover a scope
the Agent encountered at runtime (e.g. `im:message:send_as_user`).

# NOTE: an earlier version of this file maintained a denylist of shell
# metacharacters ( | ; & ` $ ( ) ) and rejected any command containing
# them. That defense was aimed at shell=True command injection — but the
# executor (lark_cli_client._exec_lark_cli) uses asyncio.create_subprocess_exec
# with an argv list, which goes straight to execve() without a shell. Those
# characters therefore have no special meaning in our path; they're just
# literal bytes in the arg string.
#
# The denylist had a real cost: legitimate message content like "S&P 500",
# "$76,000", markdown tables with "|", or parenthetical prose would fail
# validation. Agents composing a financial report would get blocked, fall
# back to probing (sending "test"/simplified messages to figure out which
# char triggered the block), and end up spamming the recipient with
# incomplete drafts.
#
# The defenses that actually matter are preserved:
#   - ALLOWED_DOMAINS whitelist (only known lark-cli subcommands)
#   - BLOCKED_PATTERNS (auth login/logout, config init — use dedicated tools)
#   - BLOCKED_FLAGS (--app-secret-stdin, --profile — secrets / isolation bypass)
#   - shlex.split + array-arg subprocess (true injection defense)
