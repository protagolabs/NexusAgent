#### SOCIAL NETWORK MODULE

##### 1. Module Purpose
You maintain a **personal social graph** that evolves through interactions.
Its purpose is to:
- Track users, agents, and organizations
- Capture identities, roles, domains, tags, and contact information
- Support search, recall, and relationship-based reasoning

Your social network should be accurate, up-to-date, and immediately enriched whenever new information appears.

**IMPORTANT:** Your agent_id is `{agent_id}`.
Always pass `agent_id="{agent_id}"` when calling social network tools.

---

##### 2. Entity Memory Rules

###### What counts as an entity
You only store **social entities** — things with agency that you can interact with:
- **user** – human users interacting with you
- **agent** – other AI agents
- **group** – teams / squads that act as a collective unit (e.g., "alpha team")

**NOT entities:** Competitions, platforms, APIs, concepts, technologies, sports teams.
These are **keywords** attached to the people associated with them.
Example: "Bitcoin Forum" is NOT an entity. "alpha4 who participated in Bitcoin Forum" IS an entity with keyword "bitcoin_forum".

###### When to record
Record new or updated information **immediately** when:
- Someone introduces themselves
- Their role, domain, or background is described
- New contact information is given
- A new agent or group is mentioned

No permission asking, no delay.

###### What to store
- Name and role/position
- Expertise/domain information
- Contextual keywords (topics, platforms, projects associated with this person)
- Aliases (alternate names, system IDs, Lark open_ids)
- Contact information
- Your conversational observations

###### Entity ID rules
- For current user: use existing `user_id` from context
- For other users/agents: `entity_{{name}}_{{timestamp}}`
- For groups: `group_{{name}}_{{timestamp}}`

---

##### 3. Core Tools & When to Use Them

###### 1. `extract_entity_info` — Remember Entities ALWAYS CALL IMMEDIATELY
**MUST CALL** whenever new identity, background, or contact information appears.

Trigger scenarios (call RIGHT AWAY):
- User says their name, role, company, or expertise
- Someone mentions another person/agent/company
- Contact info (email, phone) is shared
- Any biographical or professional detail appears

###### 2. `search_social_network` — Retrieve People / Expertise
Use when the user seeks:
- A specific person or agent
- Someone with a skill, domain, or role
- Entities that match certain tags or attributes

###### 3. `get_contact_info` — Quick Contact Lookup
Use when the user needs the contact method of a known entity.

###### 4. `get_agent_social_stats` — Relationship Summary
Use to report your interaction patterns:
recent interactions, most active contacts, strongest relationships, tag-filtered lists, etc.

###### 5. `merge_entities` — Merge Duplicate Entities
When you detect duplicate entity records (e.g., same person from different channels),
use this to merge them into one consolidated record.

---

##### 4. Keyword Rules

**Keywords serve two purposes:**
1. Contextual topics/domains associated with a person (e.g., `bitcoin_forum`, `machine_learning`, `arena42`)
2. Structured role/expertise markers (e.g., `expert:frontend`, `engineer`)

Aim for **3-5 keywords per entity** at most. Use `lowercase_with_underscores` format.

###### Contextual Keywords (primary use)
- Topics, platforms, projects the person is associated with
- Example: Person participates in Bitcoin Forum → add `bitcoin_forum`
- Example: Person works at Google on ML → add `google`, `machine_learning`

###### Expertise Level Keywords (choose ONE per domain)
- `expert:domain` — explicitly stated expertise
- `familiar:domain` — works in / familiar with the domain

###### Role Keywords
One simple role: `engineer`, `researcher`, `student`, `manager`, `designer`, `architect`

###### Strict Rules
- **Max ONE expertise keyword per domain** — do NOT add both `expert:ML` and `familiar:ML`
- **No synonyms** — `expert:recommendation_system` and `expert:recommender_systems` are duplicates, pick ONE canonical form
- **Do NOT re-add** what already exists — check existing keywords before adding new ones
- **When updating, REPLACE outdated keywords** rather than appending variations

---

##### 5. Current User Information
{social_network_current_entity}

---

##### 6. Behavior Expectations
- Maintain a coherent, growing memory of social entities (humans, agents, groups only)
- Use the correct tool promptly when information appears
- Rely on search and stats tools to answer relationship-based questions
- Keep entity data clean, structured, and deduplicated
- Never create entities for competitions, platforms, concepts, or other non-social things

DEDUP_MERGE_DECISION_INSTRUCTIONS = """You are deciding whether a newly extracted entity matches any of the existing entities in the database.

Given:
- **Candidate**: a newly extracted entity from a conversation
- **Existing entities**: numbered list [0], [1], [2]... of entities already stored

Decide: **MERGE** (with the index of the matching entity) or **CREATE_NEW**

Rules:
- MERGE if the candidate clearly refers to the same person/agent/group as one of the existing entities:
  - Same name or overlapping aliases
  - Descriptions clearly describe the same individual
  - System IDs match (e.g., Lark open_ids, platform agent IDs)
  - Different surface names but context makes it obvious (e.g., "hongyitest" and "Hongyi" with overlapping descriptions)
- CREATE_NEW if the candidate is a genuinely different entity:
  - Different roles, organizations, or contexts
  - Name similarity is coincidental
- When in doubt, **CREATE_NEW** — false negatives are cheaper than false merges
- If multiple existing entities could match, pick the one with the strongest evidence (most overlapping context)

Set merge_target_index to the [index] number of the matching entity. Output your decision and a one-line reason."""


ENTITY_SUMMARY_INSTRUCTIONS = """Summarize conversations in one brief sentence or bullet point. Focus on what the user said about themselves or discussed with the agent.

- "Introduced themselves as Alice, a recommendation systems expert"
- "Inquired about pricing and requested a discount, seems price-sensitive"
- "Said they need to discuss with their manager before deciding"
- "Discussed their friend Bob who works as a frontend engineer at Google"
- "Expressed frustration about slow response time and requested a refund"
- "Showed strong interest in the product and asked about next steps"

# Batch entity extraction LLM instructions

# ============================================================================
BATCH_ENTITY_EXTRACTION_INSTRUCTIONS = """Extract ONLY social entities mentioned in the conversation.

**Definition of a social entity:**
A social entity is a specific, individually identifiable being that has agency — it can send messages, make decisions, hold conversations, or be directly contacted. Each social entity must have a **proper name or unique identifier** that distinguishes it from all others.

Three types qualify:
- **Humans** — individually named people (not role descriptions like "a user" or "my creator")
- **AI agents** — individually named agents with their own identity (not generic references like "an agent" or "some agents")
- **Groups** — named teams or squads that act collectively and can receive messages as a unit

**What disqualifies something from being a social entity:**
- It cannot receive a message or hold a conversation (concepts, platforms, competitions, technologies)
- It is referred to only by a generic role, category, or plural noun rather than a specific name (e.g., "colleagues", "participants", "members", "users")
- It is a description of what something is rather than who it is (e.g., "a testing tool", "a scheduled task", "a prediction market")
- It is the conversation participants themselves (these are explicitly excluded below)

Non-social things mentioned alongside a person should become **keywords** on that person instead.

**Exclusion rules:**
- EXCLUDE all names listed in the exclusion list provided with each conversation — these are the conversation participants
- IGNORE channel source tags formatted like [Channel · Name · ID] — these are system metadata
- Do NOT extract pronouns or references that cannot be resolved to a specific named individual
- If no social entities are mentioned, return an empty list

**Aliases — CRITICAL for deduplication:**
- When a name appears alongside a system ID (e.g., "alpha4 (ou_alpha4_open_id)"), extract ONE entity with name="alpha4" and aliases=["ou_alpha4_open_id"]
- Lark open_ids (ou_xxx) and other platform IDs are aliases, NOT separate entities
- If the same person is referred to by multiple names, output ONCE with the most recognizable name and put alternatives in aliases

**Keywords — attach non-social context to people:**
- When a person is mentioned alongside a topic, competition, or platform, add those as keywords on the person
- Example: "alpha4 participated in Bitcoin Forum" → name="alpha4", keywords=["bitcoin_forum"]
- Example: "Bob works at Google on ML" → name="Bob", keywords=["google", "machine_learning"]
- Use 0-3 keywords per entity. Use lowercase_with_underscores format.

**Familiarity:**
- "direct" — the entity is actively participating in this conversation (sending messages, responding)
- "known_of" — the entity is only mentioned or referenced by others

**Entity type:**
- "user" — human person
- "agent" — AI agent
- "group" — team/squad that acts as a collective unit

Examples:
- "My colleague Bob is a frontend expert at Google" → Bob (user, keywords=["frontend", "google"], familiarity="known_of")
- "alpha4 (@agent_5a22e015f115:localhost) joined the Bitcoin Forum" → alpha4 (agent, aliases=["@agent_5a22e015f115:localhost"], keywords=["bitcoin_forum"], familiarity="known_of")
- "The alpha team reported their results" → alpha team (group, keywords=[], familiarity="known_of")
- "Agent Research-01 is helping me with analysis" → Research-01 (agent, keywords=["analysis"], familiarity="direct")

NOT extracted (these become keywords on people instead):
- "Bitcoin Forum competition" → NOT an entity (becomes keyword on participants)
- "Arena42 platform" → NOT an entity
- "Art Contest" → NOT an entity
- "Google" → NOT an entity (becomes keyword on Bob: keywords=["google"])"""
