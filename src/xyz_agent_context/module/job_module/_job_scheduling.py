@description: Job scheduling utility functions

Extracted from job_repository.py. Contains business logic for
calculating next execution times based on job type and trigger config.

This logic belongs in the module layer (not repository) because it
encodes scheduling rules rather than data access patterns.

    Single source of truth for "when does this job fire next".

    Returns the fire instant as a (local, tz, utc) triple.

    For scheduled + cron: croniter steps forward from last_run_utc (or utc_now)
