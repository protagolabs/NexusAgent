@description: Durable dedup store for incoming Lark WebSocket events (Bug 27).

The trigger's in-memory set is necessary but not sufficient: on every
process restart we'd lose it and Lark's at-least-once delivery would
re-deliver un-acked events, causing the agent to reply to the same user
message twice — sometimes an hour apart, exactly as an operator reported.

This repository exposes one method per operation the trigger needs:

  - ``mark_seen(message_id)`` — atomic "have we processed this message"
    gate. Returns ``True`` the first time (proceed to process),
    ``False`` every subsequent time (drop as duplicate). Survives
    restarts because the state lives in a DB row.

  - ``cleanup_older_than_days(n)`` — bounded retention. Called once at
    trigger startup so the table doesn't grow without bound.
