Database Factory - Per-event-loop database client registry

@file_name: db_factory.py
@author: NetMind.AI
@date: 2025-11-28
@description: Provides a database client keyed by the running asyncio event loop.

=============================================================================
Design Goals
=============================================================================

Problems solved:
- 40+ direct DatabaseClient() calls in code, each creating a new connection
- MCP tools cannot accept externally injected db_client (Agent cannot pass it)
- Uncontrollable connection count, may exhaust database connections
- Cross-loop pool misuse: a single process-wide singleton breaks when the
  MCP container runs each module in its own threaded event loop -- the
  aiomysql pool binds its internal Futures (e.g. Pool._wakeup) to the loop
  that created it, and reusing that pool from another loop raises
  "got Future attached to a different loop". The earlier mitigation
  (evict + recreate on loop change) only pushed the problem around:
  whichever loop lost the race held stale Futures until the next access.

Solution:
- One AsyncDatabaseClient per event loop (keyed by id(loop))
- Each loop builds its own pool, lives as long as the loop is alive
- Closed loops are evicted on every access (cheap O(n) over active loops)
- A per-loop asyncio.Lock serialises concurrent first-call on the same loop
- Legacy `get_db_client_sync` path preserved as an escape hatch for
  bootstrap code (its returned client must not be reused from async code)

Usage examples:
    # Async acquisition (recommended)
    db = await get_db_client()

    # Sync acquisition (bootstrap only; never reuse result from async code)
    db = get_db_client_sync()

    # Usage in MCP tools
    @mcp.tool()
    async def job_create(...) -> dict:
        db = await get_db_client()
        module = JobModule(database_client=db)
