@description: User-uploaded attachment data model for chat input

=============================================================================
Belongs to: ChatModule (consumption) + CommonToolsModule (system-prompt
injection) + WS payload (transport)
=============================================================================

Represents a single user-uploaded file referenced from a chat message.

Storage strategy:
- Binary content lives on disk under the agent workspace at
  `{workspace}/user_upload_files/{YYYY-MM-DD}/{file_id}{ext}`.
- This Pydantic model is the in-memory + JSON-memory + WS-payload shape that
  carries the *reference* (file_id + metadata), not the bytes.

Category derivation:
- The `category` field is derived from `mime_type` via `derive_category_from_mime`.
  Categories drive UI rendering branches and the synthesized natural-language
  marker that ChatModule injects into chat_history.

Out-of-scope for MVP (kept as future fields, intentionally not added now):
- `caption: Optional[str]` — vision-LLM-pre-generated description (Path B)

Active fields populated outside MVP:
- `transcript: Optional[str]` — Whisper STT output, set by the upload
  route for audio/* MIME types (Phase 1 of multimodal audio support).

        Strategy: surface the absolute on-disk path so the agent can
        directly call its built-in `Read` tool (which is multimodal and
        natively returns image / PDF / text content blocks). No custom
        MCP tool is needed — Anthropic's SDK ships with the right
        primitive.

        For audio/* uploads with a populated `transcript`, the
        transcribed text is appended to the marker so the agent reads
        the spoken content directly without a separate Read step. If
        `transcript` is empty/None the marker reverts to its non-audio
        shape, signalling that the agent should fall back to Read (or
        tell the user the audio could not be transcribed).

        If path resolution fails (file removed / orphan reference), the
        marker still announces the upload but tells the agent the file
        is unavailable so it does not fabricate content.
