@description: Regression guard for the "Working Memory Across Turns"
section in the BasicInfo system-prompt template.

The Agent runtime persists a turn's reasoning (Agent's `final_output`)
into chat history so the next turn's LLM reads both the reasoning and
the reply. But tool-call arguments and tool-call outputs are still
ephemeral within a single turn — they do NOT survive to the next turn.

This means: when a tool call returns a value the Agent will need later
(a `device_code`, a freshly created `job_id`, a file token, a URL it
minted), the Agent MUST restate that value in its own reasoning text
before the turn ends. Otherwise next-turn-Agent cannot reference it.

This is a cross-module rule (Lark, Job, RAG, any module that yields
machine-readable IDs), so it lives in BasicInfoModule's template where
every trigger source renders it.
