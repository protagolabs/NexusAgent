@description: H-1 fix — WS reconnect backoff resets after a healthy run.

Before the fix:
  - Line 387 `backoff = 5` ran unconditionally (dead code comment claimed
    "ran > 60s" gating that never existed).
  - Line 398 then doubled it every iteration.
  - Net effect: every disconnect compounded the backoff toward the
    120s cap even after hours of healthy session.

After the fix:
  - `_compute_next_backoff(current, ran_seconds)` returns `base` when
    the just-ended WS session ran >= 60s (a real connection), else
    doubles `current` up to `max_backoff`.
  - The `_subscribe_loop` records `time.monotonic()` at thread start
    and feeds (monotonic_now - start) to this helper.
