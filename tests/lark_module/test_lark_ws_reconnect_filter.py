@description: H-5 — historic filter baseline uses max(startup, last-ws-reconnect).

Scenario that motivated this fix:
  1. Process starts at T0.
  2. Runs 3 h healthy.
  3. WebSocket disconnects for 40 min (network partition / Lark blip).
  4. WS reconnects at T_reconnect.
  5. Lark's server-side backlog is released — events created during the
     40 min dark window are pushed at T_reconnect.

With the old baseline (_startup_time_ms only), those backlogged events
have create_time > startup, so Layer 1 passed them. Layer 2 memory TTL
was only 10 min → expired. Only Layer 3 DB kept them out — and if DB
blipped, they got processed.

With the new baseline (max(startup, last_ws_reconnect)), events older
than T_reconnect - 5 min are dropped at Layer 1, which is exactly the
right place: we already missed them live, we shouldn't process them
stale either.
