@description: Prompt-content regression guard for the incremental scope
authorization guidance.

Context: on 2026-04-22 production user demo_user_v1 ran into a Lark
`missing_scope: space:document:retrieve` error and the agent looped 6
times within 13 minutes, each time minting a fresh `auth login --scope X
--json --no-wait` URL and sending the new verification URL to her, never
polling the `device_code` from the prior mint. Root cause: the
`_IDENTITY_GUIDE` prompt and the `lark_cli` tool docstring only taught
the `--no-wait` mint half of the flow; neither taught the follow-up
`auth login --device-code D` poll on the next turn, nor the "do not
re-mint while a URL is in flight" discipline.

These tests pin the two-step, two-turn discipline into the prompt text
so future edits cannot silently regress the guidance. They are
intentionally structural (substring / phrase presence); LLM behavioural
quality is validated end-to-end in prod, not in CI.
