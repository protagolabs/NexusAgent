@description: Lock the contract that MessageBusTrigger's prompt includes an
              explicit "owner relay" directive when the triggered agent has a
              known owner. Without this directive, agents were treating peer
              bus exchanges as self-contained — replying to the peer (or
              staying silent) after processing, so the owner who asked
              "go talk to agent_B for me" never saw the reply in chat.
              The reply only landed in the Inbox, creating a silent-failure
              UX (observed in production, user complaint: "agent said it
              would tell me but only inbox shows anything").
