@description: Bug 18 — AgentRuntime must persist `event.final_output` when it
gives up early on the LLMResolverError path.

Before the fix: Step 4 (event persist) and Step 5 (hook_after_event_execution)
were unreachable because the error branch `return`-ed right after yielding
`ErrorMessage`. The Event row stayed with `final_output=NULL` forever —
the failed turn became invisible to audit queries and to any UI that
renders history from the `events` table. The user's input itself was fine
(Step 0 writes `env_context.input`), but there was no record of "what
happened when we tried to run".

This test drives the full code path against an in-memory sqlite and
checks the final_output marker shows up.
